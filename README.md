# PANACEA
CODING IS A THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE. 
Now , being confined at homes , many are filling days with their experiences of living through a pandemic . 
In my "Quarantine Diaries" , I have decided to code something on  par with the prevailing circumstance .
The concept behind the code tells the story of an anxious , claustrophobic world on pause . 
The title of the code PANACEA symbolises "Universal Remedy" .
On a main note the background picture used is hand drawn by me-Sharnetha kk . 
I believe "the time you put into editing,reworking and refining turns your first draft into second - and then into a third and, if you keep at it , eventually something great "
